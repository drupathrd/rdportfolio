            <p style="font-size:20px; margin-top: 20px;">Hello! I'm Drupath.r.d, a passionate Graphic Designer
                 and Computer Science Engineering student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. My journey 
                 in the realms of design and technology has equipped me with a unique blend of 
                 creativity and technical skills, allowing me to create innovative solutions 
                 that engage and inspire.</p>
                 <p style="font-size:20px; margin-top: 20px;">Currently, l am pursuing my degree in Computer Science Engineering, where I am gaining a solid foundation in programming, software development, and systems design. My coursework has provided me with proficiency in languages such as Python, 
                    Java, and C++, as well as experience with web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This technical knowledge enables 
                    me to approach design challenges with a comprehensive understanding of both the creative and technical aspects.
                    In addition to my engineering studies, I have a strong passion for
                     graphic design. I have honed my skills in various design tools and software, including
                      Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) and Figma.
                       My design philosophy centers around creating visually appealing and user-
                       friendly experiences that resonate with users.</p>
